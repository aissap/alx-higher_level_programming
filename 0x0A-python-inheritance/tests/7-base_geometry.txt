# BaseGeometry Class #

Usage:
------


This file contains a special class called `BaseGeometry`.

What is BaseGeometry?
--------------------

`BaseGeometry` is like a blueprint for making shapes. It knows how to calculate the area of a shape, but it needs more information about the specific shape.


 1. Calculate Area
------------------

- To find the area of a shape, use the `area()` method.
- If you try to use it now, it will say "I don't know how to do that yet!"

  2. Validate Numbers
  -------------------
- Use `integer_validator(name, value)` to check if a number is valid.
- It needs a `name` (like "width" or "height") and a `value` to check.
- If the `value` isn't a whole number, or if it's less than or equal to zero, it will say "That's not right!"

That's it! Now you know how to use `BaseGeometry`. Keep practicing and you'll get the hang of it!
